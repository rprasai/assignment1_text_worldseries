found in the file and the values are the number of times each word appears. For example, if the word “the” appears 128 times, the dictionary

2) Download this file - WorldSeriesWinners.txtPreview the document. This file contains a chronological list of the World Series’ 
winning teams from 1903 through 2009. The first line in the file is the name of the team that won in 1903, and the last line is the
 name of the team that won in 2009. (Note the World Series was not played in 1904 or 1994. There are entries in the file indicating this.)

Write a program that reads this file and creates a dictionary in which the keys are the names of the teams, and each key’s associated value is\
 the number of times the team has won the World Series. The program should also create a dictionary in which the keys are the years, and each key’s 
 associated value is the name of the team that won that year.

The program should prompt the user for a year in the range of 1903 through 2009. It should then display the name of the team that won 
the World Series that year, and the number of times that team has won the World Series.
